# Structure from Motion
### **Build environment**
Experiment Environment   
OS: Windows 11  
Language: MATLAB R2022b


```shell
Install MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox is needed
```

### **How to run code**
#### **output of program**
There will be a output, expx_camera_pose. Each row of expx_camera_pose.csv is the 6DOF camera pose relative to first frame.
#### **Experiment 1** 
```shell
1. Attach the path of images and cameraParams.mat file.
2. You can directly run my code.
3. The code will be paused to let the user draw the position of the cylinder to extract the 3D point cloud.
4. If the program fits successfully, the program will output the "expx_camera_pose.csv".
```  
#### **Experiment 2** 
```shell
1. Attach the path of images and cameraParams.mat file.
2. You can directly run my code.
3. The code will be paused to let the user draw the position of the cylinder to extract the 3D point cloud.
4. If the program fits successfully, the program will output the "expx_camera_pose.csv".
